    However, life dealt Henley a devastating blow with the untimely passing of his long-term partner, leaving him to raise their
    11 month old son alone. Channeling his heartbreak and pain into an unyielding determination, Henley embarked on a mission to
    provide for his son's needs and education while keeping their British and Afro-Caribbean heritage alive. In that pivotal moment, 
    Myra Learning Labs was born.
