  <h1>The Code</h1>
  <p>
    The Code formed in 2013, by a producer who decided to start recording original music, is an idea
    and concept which uses music to communicate. it. The idea behind it is that it can be anyone, it
    is true formlessness. The music is something that is completely genre-less, and therefore there
    are no limits.
  </p>
  <p>
    In regards to being faceless, this part of the idea is so boring now also as people only see the
    surface of it. In all I am not hiding, I have just always believed that my music is bigger than
    who 1 am, and that it has the power, to be formless and also the potential to impact the world,
    and bring people together, which is truly beautiful.<br />
    Unfortunately, people's art in many cases is unable to be removed from there physical identity
    and many rarely even entertain that idea and well the rest is obvious.

    "The reality I just want to make music, and have everyone hear it. All this other stuff is
    annoying, and continuously causes me to raise a question as to why I entered the music business,
    however I am here now, which is a choice I made, so l'm sticking to it until I reach my tipping
    point."
